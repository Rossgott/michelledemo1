   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Data Analysis Dashboard"
   
   # Create main branch
   git branch -M main
   
   # Add remote origin (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Michelle.git

## üîß Configuration Files Explained

### `netlify.toml`
- Netlify-specific configuration

- Security headers included

### `vercel.json`
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Static file serving
- Security headers and caching

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- Runs on every push to main branch

### `package.json`
- Project metadata
- Deployment scripts
- Development dependencies

## üåê Custom Domains

### GitHub Pages
1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain
2. Configure DNS with your domain provider
3. Enable HTTPS in repository settings

### Netlify
1. Go to Domain settings in Netlify dashboard
2. Add custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### Vercel
1. Go to project settings in Vercel dashboard
2. Add domain in "Domains" section

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 errors**: Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
2. **CSS not loading**: Check file paths are relative
3. **Charts not displaying**: Verify Chart.js CDN links are working
4. **File upload not working**: This is normal - file processing is client-side only

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
3. Test locally first: `npx serve .`
4. Check deployment logs on your hosting platform

## üìà Monitoring

### GitHub Pages
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- View traffic in repository Insights

### Netlify
- Built-in analytics available
- Deploy logs in dashboard

### Vercel
- Analytics and performance metrics
- Real-time deployment logs

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployed site:
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `npx serve .`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Automatic deployment will trigger

## üí° Tips

1. **Test locally first**: Always test changes locally before deploying
2. **Use branches**: Create feature branches for major changes
3. **Monitor performance**: Check loading times and optimize if needed
4. **Backup data**: Keep your CSV files in version control
5. **Custom analytics**: Add Google Analytics if needed
